            <p><strong>Bacon</strong> is a web application created to compute and store records of your saving. The data stored on databases are not encrypted. Use this app at your own risk. Although its security is a massive downfall, it is a breakthrough for the developers to make a web application like this. We, at Bacon, are doing our best to be more wise and intelligent on our decisions, also we are looking forward on learning more about software development. We'll continue to update until we're bored of it. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding,<br/><strong><i>- Bacon Team</i></strong></p>
